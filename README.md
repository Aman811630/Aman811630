Hello! I’m a Data Analyst with a serious knack for breathing life into numbers. My career is built on a solid foundation of technical skills, including Python, SQL, and a suite of data visualization tools, powered by recent certifications in data analytics and science.

There’s something incredibly satisfying about sifting through datasets, extracting patterns, and crafting stories that not only inform but also inspire action. My arsenal includes everything from advanced Excel to machine learning, and I thrive on the thrill of piecing together the puzzle that is big data.

Driven by a passion for analysis, I pride myself on my ability to create compelling narratives from datasets and deliver insights that are not just digestible but also actionable. From building dashboards in Power BI that present data in a visually appealing manner to deploying machine learning models that predict future trends, my goal is always clear – to help businesses make informed decisions based on solid data.

I've previously served as data science trainee in AlmaBetter (remote) and as Associate in Sombanshi infotech ( Lucknow ). Having +3 years of work experience in both offline and online spaces, I've gained different skill and got a chance to to sharpen them more. I love to learn and grow more and always try to push myself to achieve my goal.

Communication is my strong suit, and I’m all about simplifying complex concepts for anyone to understand. Whether it’s through exploratory studies, data cleansing, or hypothesis testing, I bring clarity to chaos and precision to projects.
